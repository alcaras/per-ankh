// `./per-ankh admin duel-event-titles` — every event story that has fired in a
// two-player multiplayer duel, with how often each one fired, swept from the
// raw saves. Feeds an event balance pass, so the counts matter as much as the
// titles: `--csv` writes a spreadsheet.
//
// SOURCE — the raw saves, not the stored blob. `story_events` only began
// shipping a game's whole history at parser 2.14.0; below that the blob carries
// the newest 100 player-scoped rows and no character- or city-scoped rows at
// all (cloud/src/schemas/game.ts). Much of the corpus predates 2.14.0, so the
// blob would answer a truncated question. The raw ZIP at saves/<game_id>.zip
// has been written on every upload since the first cloud commit (a6d637a, the
// same commit that created the games table), and the save is the authoritative
// record: each <...EventStoryTurn> container holds one child per event type
// that fired, tag name = the EVENTSTORY_* zType (docs/save-file-format.md).
//
// DUEL — map_size covers both zTypes the corpus carries: MAPSIZE_SMALLEST (the
// current name, shown in-game as "Duel") and MAPSIZE_DUEL (legacy; no longer in
// mapSize.xml). "Two-player multiplayer" is expressed as exactly two players,
// both human — that test is what actually decides it. game_mode only rules out
// the two single-player modes, so an unlisted mode (LAN is already in the
// corpus) still counts rather than being dropped unseen.
//
// Slow by nature: one wrangler spawn per save, hundreds of them. Downloads are
// cached on disk and reused, so re-running to reshape the output costs no
// further remote reads.
