// ─── nuke-user (cloud-rewrite world) ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// Order matters: games has no ON DELETE clause on its users FK, so we must
// delete games BEFORE users. Cascades handle player_summaries, game_player_turn,
// tech_events, law_events (from games), and collections, user_online_ids
// (from users).
//
// Tournament tables ALSO reference users(user_id) but WITHOUT ON DELETE CASCADE
// (tournament_admins, tournament_slots, tournament_matches.reported_by_user_id,
// tournament_beta_users.user_id/granted_by_user_id,
// tournament_match_casters.user_id). D1 enforces FKs, so a bare DELETE FROM
// users throws for anyone who ever touched a tournament — we clear those
// references first (null the nullable ones, delete the NOT NULL / own rows).
// The 0024/0025 slot_a/b_user_id and caster_user_id columns are plain TEXT
// with no FK, so they don't block and are left as a historical snapshot.
//
// Any new table that FK-references users(user_id) has to be added to the batch
// below, or nuke-user starts failing for everyone who appears in it.
