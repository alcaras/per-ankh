// The one place the app's client-side UI preferences agree on cookie policy:
// app-global (path=/), a year long, SameSite=Lax, and no HttpOnly since JS both
// writes and reads them. The UTC/local zone (pa_zone, tournament/zone-preference)
// and the 12/24-hour clock face (pa_clock, stores/clock-face) both ride it, so
// the policy can't drift between them — a change to the max-age or the SameSite
// stance lands on every preference at once.
//
// Values come back raw and each caller narrows with its own type guard, so an
// unset, unknown, or hand-edited cookie falls through to that surface's default
// instead of being trusted.
