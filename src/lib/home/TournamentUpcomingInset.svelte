	// The featured tournament's next sittings, as an inset of the home hero

	// Live-first, matching the tournament overview's own Live & Upcoming panel —
	// and through the same definition (liveAndUpcoming), so what counts as live
	// can't drift between the two. A match split across days contributes one row
	// per sitting.
	//
	// `matches` arrives already narrowed to pending (+page.ts asks the Worker
	// for that status), which is a no-op for liveAndUpcoming — partitionSchedule
	// drops every other status itself — and is why the landing page doesn't
	// carry the tournament's decided matches across to throw them away here.
	//
	// No horizon: the next few by time, however far out they are,
	// because "nothing scheduled" and "nothing scheduled this week" are different
	// claims and only the first is worth a panel's silence.
	//
	// Occupant names come from the standings maps rather than the match payload:
	// a pending match's slot_a_display_name / slot_b_display_name are NULL (the
	// snapshot is taken at report time), which is exactly the case
	// matchSlotDisplayName's live fallback covers.
