 * its own — an unrecognized nation or family, or a mirror match where two
 * players share one nation and need telling apart (see `getNationChartColor`,
 * `getFamilyChartColor`). Its six tones sit inside a 37-degree hue arc, which
 * is what makes it read as one family of browns rather than six categories;
 * for a rotation that has to keep N series apart, use `SERIES_COLORS` below.
 *
 * Color names reference standard web color naming:
 * - Copper (#C87941)
 * - Saddle Brown (#8B4513)
 * - Peru (#CD853F)
 * - Sienna (#A0522D)
 * - Chocolate (#D2691E)

 * Categorical rotation, drawn from Old World's own yield palette.
 *
 * Where `CHART_COLORS` is a fallback ramp of six browns, this is the palette
 * for a chart that needs its rows told apart — one color per bar on the laws,
 * tech and cities charts, one per person on the tournament standings and
 * caster bars. It is a subset of `YIELD_COLORS`: the eight that survive a pairwise
 * separation floor, taking each pair's distance as the *worse* of normal and
 * deuteranopic vision, so a red-green viewer sees the same eight categories.
 *
 * Closest surviving pair is Stone/Discontent at 0.056 in OKLab; the seven
 * dropped (Culture, Growth, Legitimacy, Maintenance, Money, Orders, Training)
 * each collided with a survivor below that. For scale, `CHART_COLORS`
 * bottoms out at 0.017 (Chocolate/Dark Goldenrod, deuteranopic) — close
 * enough to read as a repeat.
 *
 * The order is cyclic, not the yields' own: it maximizes the distance between
 * *neighbouring* indices, including the wrap from the last back to the first.
 * That matters most on the charts that outrun it — a 25-row tech or law chart
 * laps the palette three times — because it means a bar never sits next to a
 * near-twin of itself, and the seam where the rotation restarts contrasts as
 * hard as any other step. Adjacent separation never drops below 0.187.
 * Reordering this array is a design change, not a cosmetic one.
