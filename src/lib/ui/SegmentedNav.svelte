	// links with a raised-surface pill that slides under the active one. Shared
	// by the tournament views (TournamentViewTabs) and a game's Analysis/Map
	// toggle (GameHeader) — both sit in the centre of their page's header, so
	// "which view am I on" reads at a glance in the same shape on both.
	//
	// Links rather than buttons: nav semantics, so aria-current, not
	// aria-pressed. The pill is the sole active indicator and the text stays
	// tan. The caller resolves the hrefs and says which one is active, so the
	// pill lands on the right item in the SSR'd first paint instead of sliding
	// into place on hydration.
	//
	// Not for the in-page switches that toggle a view of the same route (the
	// science and empire switches, the tournament overview's toggles): those
	// are buttons carrying aria-pressed, or a bits-ui ToggleGroup.
