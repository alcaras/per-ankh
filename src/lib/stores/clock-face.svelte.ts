// The viewer's sticky 12/24-hour clock FACE — whether a local time reads
// "7:30 PM" or "19:30". Companion to the UTC/local zone preference (pa_zone,
// $lib/tournament/zone-preference): that one picks which clock a time is read
// on, this one picks how that clock is written. Both persist through the shared
// preference-cookie policy in $lib/utils/pref-cookie.
//
// Unset means "follow the browser", which is what every viewer got before this
// control existed. An explicit choice exists because the browser cannot answer
// the question: every OS has a 24-hour setting and none of them expose it to
// JS, so Intl answers from the LANGUAGE instead. CLDR ships no en-XX tailoring
// for Belarus, Russia, Brazil, Türkiye, China or most of the Balkans, so an
// English-language browser in any of them falls back to bare "en" and reports
// an American face to a reader whose own OS writes 19:00. Western Europe is
// unaffected — en-DE, en-FR, en-PL and friends all have tailorings and already
// read 24-hour.
//
// A module singleton rather than per-tournament context (ZoneClock): the face
// is a property of the viewer, not of a tournament, and governs any local time
// the app renders. Calling clockFaceIs12Hour() inside a template or $derived
// subscribes to it, so a flip re-renders every time on the page — the same
// mechanism nowMs() uses in now.svelte.ts.
