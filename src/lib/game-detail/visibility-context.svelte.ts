// A game's public/private state, shared by its two views (the analyst view at
// /games/[id] and the map view at /games/[id]/map). The [id] layout constructs
// one instance and provides it via context; each view's GameHeader binds its
// GameActions lock to it.
//
// It lives above the views because the lock is optimistic: the toggle flips
// `isPublic` and saves it, but never refetches (rename and collection moves
// call invalidateAll(); the lock doesn't). A header that owned the state would
// re-seed from the shared load's stale `is_public` after a view switch, and
// show a game the owner just made public as private.
