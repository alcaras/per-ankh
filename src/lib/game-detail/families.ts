// Pure aggregation for the Families tab.
//
// Old World's families are a political system with an economic price tag: a
// family's opinion of its player sets an upkeep modifier on every city it
// holds, from +50% when furious to −20% when friendly. What lives here is the
// opinion series itself, the band an opinion falls in, and the tallies that
// turn a game's worth of opinions into "how well was this managed, and what
// did it cost".
//
// Kept out of the components so the shapes stay testable, and separate from
// economy.ts because the two tabs are separate.
