// Integration test for the stats-cache invalidation on POST
// /v1/admin/games/:id/reindex.
//
// Reindex is the backfill tool: it rebuilds game_player_turn from the stored
// blob so a column added after upload gets filled. That makes it a writer of
// exactly the rows every corpus's bundle aggregates, and those bundles are
// cached for 24h under keys that do not drift on a re-derivation at the same
// parser version — the user key has no per-game segment, the tournament key
// moves only on a tournament mutation, and the global keys carry no game at
// all. So without an explicit invalidation a sweep's whole point is invisible
// until the TTL runs out. Worse than merely late: the Yields panel drops a band
// that is entirely null, so a corpus the sweep hasn't reached is
// indistinguishable from one with nothing to show.
//
// The subject is that invalidation, asserted through the effect rather than the
// mechanism: a reader sees pre-backfill values, the sweep runs, and the next
// read sees the backfilled ones — on the owner's corpus and the tournament's
// alike, since one reindexed game is in both.
