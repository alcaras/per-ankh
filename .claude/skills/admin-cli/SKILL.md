  Operate the live Per-Ankh app via `./per-ankh admin` — inspect or manage
  users, games, events, security, and tournaments — or run the
  local-only dev helpers (dev-login, tournament seed). Use when the user asks
  to look up a user/game, check stats or events, moderate/block/nuke shares,
  grant tournament beta/admin, seed a local fixture, or mint a local dev
  session. NOT for writing app code.

# Cloud Admin CLI (`./per-ankh admin`)

**Red line — read first.** `./per-ankh admin` defaults to **production**. Never run it against production or with `--staging`/`--remote` — including read-only reads — unless the user's current message explicitly asks for that exact command; ask first. It authenticates against the user's Cloudflare account (a 1Password prompt on this machine). Only the `--local` path (and the hard-local-only `dev-login` / `tournament seed`) is safe to run unprompted.

`./per-ankh admin` is the operator CLI for the live app. Implementation lives under `scripts/admin/`. Calls `wrangler` directly (no API key — relies on `wrangler login`). Run `./per-ankh admin --help` for the full list. The list below is illustrative, not exhaustive — `--help` groups the full surface (Stats, Users, Creator channels, Games, Events, Corpus sweeps, Security, Tournaments, Caches, Dev).

```bash
./per-ankh admin stats                       # Global counts + recent activity
./per-ankh admin users [--limit N] [--sort recent|uploads|created]
./per-ankh admin user <user_id>              # Detail (games, collections, online_ids)
./per-ankh admin add-channel <user_id> <url|@handle>   # Link a creator's YouTube channel to a user (resolves + upserts)
./per-ankh admin remove-channel <user_id> <platform>  # Unlink a user's channel
./per-ankh admin list-channels [--limit N]            # All linked creator channels (roster for the home strip)
./per-ankh admin games [--limit N] [--user U]
./per-ankh admin events [--type T] [--user U]
./per-ankh admin nuke-user <user_id>         # Delete cloud user + games + R2 blobs (type "nuke")
```

## Corpus sweeps

`./per-ankh admin duel-event-titles [--csv] [--out FILE] [--concurrency N] [--cache-dir DIR]` lists the event stories that have fired in a two-player multiplayer duel, one row per event type with the counts an event balance pass needs: `games` (duel games it fired in), `player_games` (player slots that fired it, at most two per game), and `character_city_records` (characters and cities holding their own record of it). `--csv` writes a spreadsheet instead of the markdown table. Unlike every other read command it is a **sweep**: one `wrangler` spawn per matching save (hundreds), so budget minutes, not seconds. Saves land in `--cache-dir` and are reused, so a second run to reshape the output reads nothing remote.

It reads the raw ZIPs rather than the parsed blobs on purpose — `story_events` only began carrying a game's whole history at parser 2.14.0, and older blobs hold just the newest 100 player-scoped rows with no character- or city-scoped ones at all. The save itself is the authoritative record of what fired.

## Tournaments

`./per-ankh admin tournament <sub>` — `create`, `list`, `show`, `delete`, `grant-admin`, `revoke-admin`, `seed`, `beta-grant`, `beta-revoke`, `beta-list`:

```bash
./per-ankh admin tournament beta-grant <discord_id>    # Add to the tournament create-allowlist (CLI-only)
./per-ankh admin tournament beta-list                  # Show the create-allowlist
./per-ankh admin --local tournament seed <slug> [name] # Build a full local fixture (see below)
```

Build a full local fixture (Swiss + championship via the real planner) with `./per-ankh admin --local tournament seed <slug> [name]`, flags `--qualifiers N` (default 6), `--players-per-division N` (default 8), `--fill mid-swiss|swiss-done|mid-championship|complete` (default `mid-championship`).

## Caches (KV)

`./per-ankh admin cache list [--kind stats|videos] [--match S] [--limit N]` and `./per-ankh admin cache clear <stats|videos|all> [--match S]` inspect and drop the two KV caches — stats bundles (`cloud/src/stats/cache.ts`) and YouTube feeds (`cloud/src/video/cache.ts`). Both share the `SESSIONS_KV` namespace with `session:`/`oauth:` keys; the command's prefix allowlist is what keeps those unreachable, so no flag combination can sign users out.

```bash
./per-ankh admin cache list --kind stats --match ':user:abc123:'   # One user's bundles
./per-ankh admin cache clear stats --match 'stats:v7-'             # Drop one schema version
./per-ankh admin cache clear videos                                # Force a YouTube refetch
```

Unlike the Worker's `invalidateStatsCache` (which walks only the current `BUNDLE_SCHEMA_VERSION`), `clear` sweeps every schema version under the prefix — that's what reaches entries orphaned by a version bump. Clearing `videos` costs YouTube Data API quota on the next playlist view.

**The parsed-game blob cache is a different layer and this command cannot reach it.** It caches R2 bytes for `games/{id}.json.gz` in each POP's Cache API storage (`cloud/src/blob-cache.ts`), which has no CLI surface — `wrangler` has no cache command, and zone purge can't address the keys because they're synthetic and belong to no zone. It also needs no operator action: the key carries the game's `parser_version`, so a reparse drifts the key and every POP misses at once. If a game somehow serves stale bytes anyway, that's the D1-batch-rollback path in `handleGameUpload` (the Worker evicts locally there) and the entry expires on its own within 24h. The `Cache-Control: s-maxage` directives on game responses are inert at the edge — Workers run before the cache, so nothing stores them (issue #150).

## Dev (local only)

`./per-ankh admin --local dev-login [--username NAME]` provisions a fake local user + 30-day session cookie (and adds them to the tournament create-allowlist) for testing a second account. Both `tournament seed` and `dev-login` are **local-only** and refuse to run against remote (staging included). For the browser-side Discord-free login bypass, see `docs/dev-login.md`.

## Flags & targeting

Add `--json` to any read command for pipeable output; add `--yes` to skip confirmation on destructive ops. `--local` targets the local `.wrangler` state; `--staging` targets the staging D1/R2 (remote, mutually exclusive with `--local`); the default is **production**. The dev-only commands (`dev-login`, `tournament seed`) refuse both remote targets, staging included.
